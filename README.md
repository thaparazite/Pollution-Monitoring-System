# Pollution-Monitoring-System 

## Project Overview:
The Pollution Monitoring System is a real-time monitoring solution designed to track environmental conditions in various indoor settings such as hospitals, buildings, and offices. It collects data on temperature, humidity, air quality, and noise level, providing users with valuable insights into the health and safety of indoor environments. The application achieves this by simulating real data through the generation of random values for environmental parameters. This simulation allows users to experience the system's functionality and visualize potential scenarios without the need for physical sensors or external data sources.

## Project Significance:
This project addresses the growing concern over indoor air quality and its impact on human health and productivity. By continuously monitoring environmental parameters, the Pollution Monitoring System helps users detect potential pollutants or adverse conditions, allowing for timely interventions to improve indoor air quality and occupant comfort.

## Getting Started:
|**Step**|**Description**|
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Clone the repository to your local machine.|
| 2  | Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current).|
| 3  | Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the server directory.|
| 4  | Install the required dependencies for the server:
          1. Install gRPC library: npm install @grpc/grpc-js
          2. Install proto-loader: npm install @grpc/proto-loader|
| 5  | Once the dependencies are installed, run the server by executing node server.js.|
| 6  | Open another terminal or command prompt and navigate to the client directory.|
| 7  | Install the required dependencies for the client:
|    |      1. Install gRPC library: npm install @grpc/grpc-js
|    |      2. Install proto-loader: npm install @grpc/proto-loader|
| 8  | After the dependencies are installed, run the client using node client.js.|
| 9  | Follow the CLI prompts to select the desired environmental service and view real-time data.|
